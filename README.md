VISIO TrOCR-Based OCR System

Project Overview
* VISIO is a deep learning based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system built using Microsoft’s TrOCR models.
* It supports recognition of:
  -Printed text
  -Handwritten text
  -Curved text (using a fine-tuned TrOCR model)
  *The system provides accurate text extraction through a Streamlit-based web interface along with text-to-speech audio output.

Features:
-TrOCR for printed text recognition
-TrOCR for handwritten text recognition
-Fine-tuned TrOCR model for curved text
-Cleaned and post-processed OCR output
-Text-to-Speech (TTS) for recognized text
-Simple and interactive Streamlit UI
-Fully deep-learning based OCR (no classical OCR engines used)

Technologies Used:
-Python
-Streamlit
-PyTorch
-Hugging Face Transformers
-Microsoft TrOCR
-gTTS (Text-to-Speech)
